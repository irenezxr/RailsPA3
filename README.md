This website application is an online course registration system.

Homepage of this website is a Login page. Since there's no user in the database yet, 
you should create your own account by clicking the "Sign up now" button.

Upon signing up, you will be directed into your account directly. What you are seeing is
all the courses that you are enrolled to. At this stage, there should be no classes there
since you have registered for zero classes.

On the Search page, by typing in course name and/or selecting subjects, you can see the list
of courses updated accordingly. Only partial of the webpage is updated.

There is an "enroll" button behind each course, which allow you to register for it. By 
clicking that button, the corresponding course will be added to your account, and you will 
immediately see it listed on the home page of your account.
