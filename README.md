This website application is an online course registration system.

Homepage of this website is a Login page. Since there's no user in the database yet, 
you should create your own account by clicking the "Sign up now" button.

Upon signing up, you will be directed into your account directly. What you are seeing is
all the courses that you are enrolled to. At this stage, there should be no classes there
since you have registered for zero classes.

On the up-right you will see a "Search" button. Clicking that will re-direct you to a search page
where you can search courses based on course name and subjects. The drop-box for subjects is optional,
you will still be able to search courses without selecting any courses from the dropbox. Clicking
the "Search" button will yield the searching results.

There is an "enroll" button behind each course, which allow you to register for it. By clicking
that button, the corresponding course will be added to your account, and you will immediately see
it listed on the home page of your account.
